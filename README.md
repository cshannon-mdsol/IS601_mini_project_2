This project will have multiple parts:

## Project Plan:
[Click here](https://github.com/cshannon-mdsol/IS601_mini_project_2/blob/master/Project_Plan.md) to see our groups project plan to see how each statistic function relates to each other.

Basic Calculations (Calculator.py):
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Square
6. Square Root

Statistical Functions (Statistics.py):
- [x] Mean
- [x] Median
- [x] Mode
- [x] Variance
- [x] Standard Deviation
- [X] Quartiles
- [x] Skewness
- [x] Sample Correlation
- [ ] Population Correlation
- [x] Z-Score
- [x] Mean Deviation / Mean Absolute Deviation

Random Generator Functions (Random.py):
- [x] Generate random number without seed
- [x] Generate random number with seed
- [x] Generate a list of random numbers with a seed between a range of provided numbers
- [x] Select random item from a list
- [x] Select same value from a list with seed
- [x] Select items from a list without seed
- [x] Select items from a list with seed

Population Sampling Functions (Sampling.py):
- [x] Simple random sampling
- [x] Systematic sampling
- [x] Confidence Interval for a Sample
- [x] Margin of Error
- [x] Cochran's Sample Size Formula
- [x] How to find a sample size given a confidence interval and width (unknown population standard deviation)
- [x] How to find a sample size given a confidence interval and width (known population standard deviation)

This uses both built-in functions and CSV data sheets to test the functionality of the calculator.
